I am PhD candidate in Public Affairs. I am interested in research questions at the intersection of energy policy, public perceptions and public health. My dissertation focuses on how institutions, public policies and individual perceptions influence decision-making and health outcomes, primarily in the energy policy domain. This dissertation utilizes a broad array of research methodologies, including survey research, mixed-methods research design, and empirical analysis using large data. 

 My research projects fall into three main categories: (1) perceptions towards fossil fuel extraction; (2) unintended consequences of environmental regulations; and (3) impediments to health-seeking behaviors.

Currently, a large portion of my research portfolio is dedicated to understanding black lung disease. I am particularly focused on identifying the barriers to coal miners’ participation in federal healthcare screening programs, and evaluating the effect of energy policies on disease incidence rates. 

 I will receive my Ph.D. in Public Affairs from the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. I received my Masters of Science in Environmental Policy from the School for Environment and Sustainability from the University of Michigan, and Bachelors of Arts in Economics, also from the University of Michigan. 

 In my spare time, I love to garden, rock climb, hike and cook large meals with friends.
