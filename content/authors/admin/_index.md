I am PhD candidate in Public Affairs. I am interested in research questions at the intersection of energy policy, public perceptions and public health. My dissertation focuses on how institutions, public policies and individual perceptions influence decision-making and health outcomes, primarily in the energy policy domain. This dissertation utilizes a broad array of research methodologies, including survey research, mixed-methods research design, and empirical analysis using large data. 

My research projects fall into three main categories: (1) perceptions towards fossil fuel extraction; (2) unintended consequences of environmental regulations; and (3) impediments to health-seeking behaviors.

Currently, a large portion of my research portfolio is dedicated to understanding black lung disease. I am particularly focused on identifying the barriers to coal miners’ participation in federal healthcare screening programs, and evaluating the effect of energy policies on disease incidence rates. 

I will receive my Ph.D. in Public Affairs from the [O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs](https://oneill.indiana.edu/) at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu). I received my Masters of Science in Environmental Policy from the [School for Environment and Sustainability](https://seas.umich.edu/) from the University of Michigan, and [Bachelors of Arts in Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ), also from the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu). 

In my spare time, I love to garden, rock climb, hike and cook large meals with friends.
